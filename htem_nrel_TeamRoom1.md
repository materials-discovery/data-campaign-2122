## Collect and analyse existing materials data repositories and e-science platforms 

### Template (copy and fill) 

- website name: **HTEM DB**
- website URL: **https://htem.nrel.gov/**
- brief description: The mission of **HTEM DB** is to enable discovery of new materials with useful properties by releasing large amounts of high-quality experimental data to public. The **HTEM DB (High Throughput Experimental Materials Database)** contains information about materials obtained from high-throughput experiments at **NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory)**.
