 ### Description:
>  By calculating the properties of all known materials, the Materials Project aims to take the guesswork out of materials design for a variety of applications. Through computational materials science, many properties of materials can be predicted before the material is synthesized. This allows experimental studies to target the most promising compounds and enables researchers to data-mine scientific trends in materials properties. By providing materials researchers with the information they need to design better, the Materials Project aims to accelerate innovation in materials research.
