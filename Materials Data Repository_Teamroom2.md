# Assignment in DDMD class - NSCI0028/Term2/2122

## Collect and analyse existing materials data repositories and e-science platforms 

- note, if the platform does not have, or have in addition applications or other assets, adapt the format appropriately, e.g., bu replacing data with Apps. Add field as needed. 
- you can drag and drop images below too.

  * Describe the classes and types of materials covered. 
* Access rights: 
  - [ ] Free to all 
  - [ ] Commercial 
* where is the data coming from:  
  - [ ] any one can upload data 
  - [ ] provided by repository or platform owners
* Format of the data:
  - [ ] Standard formats
  - [ ] specific formats
* Size of the database: _....._ 
* If you use data from this platfor, how are you going to cite it? is there a requirement on the cite? 
* what is the license of the platofrm it self? of the data on it? 
 
 ### Description:
> Please give an overview summary of the repository which you can present to the class. 


> give informstion about the quality of the data in the repository. Is it validated? would you use it in your mission critical applications as is? Discuss.
