# Assignment in DDMD class - NSCI0028/Term2/2022

## Collect and analyse existing materials data repositories and e-science platforms 

### Template (copy and fill) 
* website name: The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)
* website URL: https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-core/components/csd/
* brief description: The CSD is a repository for small-molecue organic and metal-organinc crystals. It was maintained by Cambridge University. In 1965, CSD was established by a research group led by Olga Kennard. Today there are over 1 million structures in the CSD.
* Modelling Data 
  - [ ] Density Functional Theory (DFT)/ Electronic Models
  - [ ] Molecular Dynamics/Atomistic Simulations
  - [ ] Coarse Grained Molecular Dynamics
  - [ ] Continumm 
  - [X] Other
        - if other specify: only experimental data obtained through X-ray and neutron diffraction are stored in the CSD.
* Experimental Data: 
  *  X-ray and neutron diffraction analyses of crystals.
* Access rights: 
  - [X] Free to all 
  - [ ] Commercial 
* where is the data coming from:  
  - [ ] any one can upload data 
  - [X] provided by repository or platform owners
 
 
 ### Description:
> Please give an overview summary of the repository which you can present to the class.
