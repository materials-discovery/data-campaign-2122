  - [ ] provided by repository or platform owners
* Format of the data:
  - [ ] Standard formats
  - [ ] specific formats
  - Plain CIF files; ZIP archives that contain CIF files.
* Size of the database: 22’145’443 crystal structures, 7’521’504 structures, 2’965’252 data and calculation nodes, 674’778 reproducible calculations.(Structures counted with an automated script, no check for duplicates has been performed)



 ### Description:
Materials Clould is a open-science platform for sharing resources for computational science which is driven by applications in materials modelling. It hosts:
* 1 Archival and dissemination services for raw and curated data, together with their provenance graph
* 2 Modelling services and virtual machines
* 3 Tools for data analytics, and pre-/post-processing
* 4 Educational materials. 
> Date can be cited and archived persistently to provide a comprehensive embodiment of all caculations, codes and data in the form of graphs allow retracing and reproducing results.
