# Assignment in DDMD class - NSCI0028/Term2/2122

## Collect and analyse existing materials data repositories and e-science platforms 

- note, if the platform does not have, or have in addition applications or other assets, adapt the format appropriately, e.g., bu replacing data with Apps. Add field as needed. 
- you can drag and drop images below too.

 ### Description:
> Please give an overview summary of the repository which you can present to the class. 


> give informstion about the quality of the data in the repository. Is it validated? would you use it in your mission critical applications as is? Discuss.
