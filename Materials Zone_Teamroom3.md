# Assignment in DDMD class - NSCI0028/Term2/2022

## Collect and analyse existing materials data repositories and e-science platforms 

### Teamroom 3_Materials Zone
* website name: Materials Zone
* website URL: https://www.materials.zone/
* brief description: Materials zone is a digital materials R&D (research and development) platform which is used to discover new materials, design cost-efficient and robust production lines, and predict future failures. On this platform data is collected effectively from independent entities, materials providers, factories, and manufacturing facilities , a secured platform is provided for their communication. This platform acts as a bridge between materials discovery and manufacturing and has a significant influence on both the academic world and the industrial world.
* Modelling Data 
  - [ ] Density Functional Theory (DFT)/ Electronic Models
  - [ ] Molecular Dynamics/Atomistic Simulations
  - [ ] Coarse Grained Molecular Dynamics
  - [ ] Continumm 
  - [X] Spectroscopy
  - [X] Other
        - if other specify: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML). 
* Experimental Data: 
  *  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
    *  Create analytical and statistical models that correlate formulations with processing parameters of novel materials
    *  Interpret data in the best possible way by using active and customized dashboard panels, advanced visualization, and presentation tools
    *  ......
 
* Access rights:

  - [X] Commercial 
* where is the data coming from:  
  - [X] any one can upload data 
  - [X] provided by repository or platform owners
 
 
 ### Description:
> Please give an overview summary of the repository which you can present to the class. 
> 
> The website our Group 3 viewed is called Materials Zone which is a bridge that connects materials discovery and manufacturing. This platform houses a variety of tools capable of accelerating materials research.It automatically harvests experimental data and structures it into a personalized database, to enable analyses with state of the art AI/ML algorithms. It not only advents new technologies, but also improves data management, acting as a useful tool for scientists and engineers.
