# Assignment in DDMD class - NSCI0028/Term2/2122

## Collect and analyse existing materials data repositories and e-science platforms 

- note, if the platform does not have, or have in addition applications or other assets, adapt the format appropriately, e.g., bu replacing data with Apps. Add field as needed. 
- you can drag and drop images below too.

 ### Description:
> Dataset Search is a search engine for datasets. Using a simple keyword search, users can discover datasets hosted in thousands of repositories across the Web. Dataset Search's mission is to: foster a data sharing ecosystem that will encourage data publishers to follow best practices for data storage and publication or give scientists a way to show the impact of their work through citation of datasets that they have produced


> give informstion about the quality of the data in the repository. Is it validated? would you use it in your mission critical applications as is? Discuss.
