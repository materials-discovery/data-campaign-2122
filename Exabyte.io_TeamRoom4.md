 ### Description (4)(5):
 Exabyte.io’s simulation and modelling product allows materials scientists the capability to design and prototype new compounds in a rapid and cost-effective manner with applications in a variety of fields including semiconductor, clean energy, aerospace/automotive, and others. ***It has since been relaunched as an entirely new start-up called Mat3ra (https://mat3ra.com/) by the same founder.*** The platform lets users design new compounds using simulation tools that run physics-based and machine-learning models to predict behaviors and outcomes. It can model new compounds, starting from the interactions between individual atoms, and show how they perform together as a new material, according to the company. Through AI-based simulations, Mat3ra’s technology can accelerate materials research-and-development efforts that traditionally have required trial-and-error experimentation.
