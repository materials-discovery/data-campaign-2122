 ### Description:

> Please give an overview summary of the repository which you can present to the class. 

> **Ansys Granta** was formerly known as **Granta Design** Inc. founded in 1994 as a spin-off from the University of Cambridge Engineering Department by Professors Mike Ashby and David Cebon. **Granta Design** Inc. pioneered the field of materials information technology. On 12 February 2019, the company was acquired by **Ansys** Inc. becoming an excellent enterprise materials intelligence management system and its market-leading materials sourcing, selection and management solution available to **Ansys** clients. **Granta**'s seamless integration with numerous **Ansys** finite element solvers brings high-quality and comprehensive materials information to the latter to help it obtain accurate simulation results.
> 
> In the Ansys Granta series, **MI Enterprise** is the leading system for enterprise materials information management; **MI PRO** is the fast-start materials data management solution to bring accurate, consistent data to every engineering team; **Selector** is the standard tool for materials selection and graphical analysis of materials properties; **MDS** provides instant, clickable access to the materials property data needed, eliminating data search time and input errors; and **EduPack** supports Materials Education from teaching of introductory materials topics to post-graduate courses.
