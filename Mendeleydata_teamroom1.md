 ### Description:
Mendeley Data repository was launched in 2015, to enable researchers to post research data, gain greater exposure, and track usage of their data, which basing on Open Access Information System (OAIS) model. An end user can create a Draft dataset in Mendeley Data via the web-based User Interface. As soon as a draft dataset is first created, it is auto-saved, and stored safely. Alternatively, any external system can be configured to create a Draft dataset via the public API. Once a dataset has been confirmed as being valid based the on the criteria listed above, it is then archived in the Data Archiving and Network Services (DANS) long term repository. Datasets can be viewed and downloaded from the Mendeley Data website by end users. External systems are also able to query and download any published and valid dataset via the Mendeley Data public API.
