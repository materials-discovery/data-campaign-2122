# Assignment in DDMD class - NSCI0028/Term2/2022

## Collect and analyse existing materials data repositories and e-science platforms 

### Group 3_Exabyte
* website name: Exabyte
* website URL: https://exabyte.io/
* brief description: Exabyte.io is a cloud-native digital materials R&D (research and development) platform which is used to design structures, construct workflows,run simulations, analyze data, and build proper models. On this platform data is collected effectively for predicting the properties of materials, and it is convenient for users around the world to achieve an online collaboration.

 ### Description:
> Please give an overview summary of the repository which you can present to the class. 
> 
> The website our Group 3 looked into is called Exabyte. Exabyte platform is a "digital ecosystem" that brings together experts coming from multiple scientific backgrounds, allowing data inported, run and outputed that further aids the process of Artificial Intelligence. There are three main functions that the platform can achieve. First, it allows the building up of designed materials from atoms. Second is the simulation of the proposed materials, which helps prediction of material properties. Last but not the least, users can access information like python scripts of different materials on a daily basics. Compared to the traditional way of building up materials by the "trial and error " approach, Exabyte allows successful material inventions in merely 2 days with reduced simulation times, which greatly enhance the effeciency. 
> The engines are based on several models like Hartree-Fock Theory, Density Functional Theory (DFT), classical Molecular Dynamics, etc. Free accounts are available to the users, and there are also options for commercial uses such as an extra payment for increasing storage quota.
