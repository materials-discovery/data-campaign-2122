 ### Description:
software: By computing properties of all known materials, the Materials Project aims to remove guesswork from materials design in a variety of applications. Experimental research can be targeted to the most promising compounds from computational data sets. 
supercomputers: Supercomputing clusters at national laboratories provide the infrastructure that enables our computations, data, and algorithms to run at unparalleled speed. 
screening: Computational materials science is now powerful enough that it can predict many properties of materials before those materials are ever synthesized in the lab.
