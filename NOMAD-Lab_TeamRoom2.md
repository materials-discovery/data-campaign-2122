# Assignment in DDMD class - NSCI0028/Term2/2022

## Collect and analyse existing materials data repositories and e-science platforms 

- note, if the platform does not have, or have in addition applications or other assets, adapt the format appropriately, e.g., bu replacing data with Apps. Add field as needed. 
- you can drag and drop images below too. 


### Template (copy&paste to new file and fill up) 
* website name: NOMAD Laboratory

* brief description: The Novel Material Discovery (NOMAD) Laboratory is a platform to create, collect, store, and cleanses computational materials science data, and provides tools for mining this data.
* Modelling Data 
  - [X] Molecular Dynamics
  - [X] Density Functional Theory (DFT)
  - [ ] Coarse Grained Molecular Dynamics
  - [ ] Continum
  - [ ] Other
        - if other specify: 
* Experimental Data: 
* Materials aggregate calculations based on common system properties (e.g. system type, atoms, lattice, space group, etc.).
* Access rights: 
  - [X] Free to all 
  - [ ] Commercial 
* where is the data coming from:  
  - [X] any one can upload data 
  - [ ] provided by repository or platform owners
* Format of the data:
  - [X] Standard formats
  - [ ] specific formats

* If you use data from this platfor, how are you going to cite it? is there a requirement on the cite? 
* what is the license of the platofrm it self? of the data on it? 
* Citing the data with a DOI： You may curate your data and create datasets to give them a hierarchical structure. These functions are available from the Your data page by selecting and editing data. You can assign a DOI for your datasets. The DOIs are provided in cooperation with Humboldt Universities library and will be resolved through the usual DOI handle systems.
* Data can be downloaded and used under the CC-BY-4.0 license. 

 ### Description:
The NOMAD Laboratory is a user-driven platform for sharing and analysing computational materials science data. It takes into account the various features of data as a crucial raw material that is critical for accelerating materials research and engineering. It develops several Big-Data Services based on its open-access data that aid in the advancement of materials science and engineering. NOMAD is the world's largest data collection in this field, with the NOMAD Repository and its code-independent and normalised form, the NOMAD Archive. Numerous services are offered on the basis of its discoverable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable data infrastructure, including advanced visualisation, the NOMAD Encyclopedia, and artificial intelligence tools.
