 ### Description:
The OQMD is a DFT database containing thermodynamical and structural data of 1,022,603 materials. Two types of structures are present in the database, structures from the ICSD and structural prototype, which is generally "crystal structure commonly observed in nature for a variety of chemical compositions" [1]. The database is open-access and was created by  Chris Wolverton's group in Northwestern University.
