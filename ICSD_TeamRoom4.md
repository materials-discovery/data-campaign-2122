# Assignment in DDMD class - NSCI0028/Term2/2022

## Collect and analyse existing materials data repositories and e-science platforms 
* Website name: ISCD
* Website URL: https://icsd.fiz-karlsruhe.de/index.xhtml
* Brief description: 
> ICSD is a large database in domains of crystallography and comprises. ICSD is one of the world’s largest databases for fully identified inorganic materials crystal structures which was founded in 1978 by Günter Bergerhoff (University of Bonn) and I. D. Brown (University of McMaster, Canada). It is now run by FIZ Karlsruhe in Europe and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. Bascially, collaborating and networking with the Cambridge Crystal Data Centre (CCDC) in Great Britain, Technicum in Stuttgart and the Vinca Institute of Nuclear Science in Belgrade as well as the International Centre for Diffraction Data in the USA make sure the quality and completeness of the data.

 ### Description:
> There are already around 200,000 crystal structures in ICSD. It's updated twice a year with the most up-to-date information from scientific publications and other sources. Every year, over 7,000 new structures are added. The earliest data sets are from 1913, which is when x-ray diffractometry was first published. It aims to collect all inorganic crystal structures published since then, including pure elements, minerals, metals, and intermetallic complexes (with atomic coordinates). As of December 2020, ICSD has more than 210,000 entries.
For scientists working in the domains of crystallography, mineralogy, geology, materials science, and inorganic chemistry, precise knowledge on the crystalline characteristics of materials is critical. This data can be used to address materials science problems, anticipate and optimise material qualities, and improve analytics.
