 ### Description:
> Aflow is supported by the Autonomous Materials Design Center for Materials Science at Duke University. Aflow can be of great help when we need a new type of material in a specific project. It is not only a huge material database, but also a highly mechanized computational tool. At the heart of the high-throughput framework AFLOW is the realization of ground-state energies to determine stable and metastable structures. In addition to this, he is also involved in phase diagram construction, electronic band structure, surface stability, superconductivity, identification and classification of crystal circular structures, etc. Currently, Aflow is continuously developing, supplementing the database, and integrating new applications on a regular basis.
