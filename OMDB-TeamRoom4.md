 ### Description:
> OMBD, developed by the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics â€“ Nordita, is an open access database for over 40000 organic materials. Based on the information from publications and DFT model, OMBD provides the information for interactive crystal structure plot, crystallographic information and interactive electronic structure data, computational input files are available as well. It also offers graphical ranking of energy gap, space group, magnetization, cluster graph, crystal density and effective light hole/heavy hole/electron mass for easier comparison and searching.
