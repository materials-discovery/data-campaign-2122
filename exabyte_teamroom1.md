 ### Description:
> Please give an overview summary of the repository which you can present to the class. 
Founded in 2015, Exabyte.io is a cloud-based software company headquartered in San Francisco, California. 
It enables materials scientists and engineers in academic and industrial sectors, including energy, semiconductor, and manufacturing, to rapidly adopt and deploy a wide variety of modeling techniques to develop new materials faster.Exabyte.io is building a cloud-native, modular, accessible and collaborative modeling platform.
Exabyte.io is the only end-to-end materials modeling platform. It is architected to consolidate any state-of-the-art simulation tools and data, allowing its users to design new compounds and run physics-based and machine-learning models. The purpose-built platform lets customers increase the impact of high-end simulations and accelerate R&D.
