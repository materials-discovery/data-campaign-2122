 ### Description:
 International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) is established at 1948 with 40 member states and rigions. They have 4 main objectives as follows:
    1.promote international cooperation in crystallography and to contribute to all aspects of crystallography
    2.promote international publication of crystallographic research,
    3.benefit standardization of methods, units, nomenclatures and symbols
    4.form a focus for the relations of crystallography to other sciences.
    They achieve these objectives by providing a platform with publish relavant journals and references online, promoting the world dictionary and database for crystallographer, setting relavant prizes, orgnizing congresses regularly and so on.
