## Collect and analyse existing materials data repositories and e-science platforms 

- note, if the platform does not have, or have in addition applications or other assets, adapt the format appropriately, e.g., bu replacing data with Apps. Add field as needed. 
- you can drag and drop images below too. 


### Template (copy&paste to new file and fill up)

* If you use data from this platfor, how are you going to cite it? is there a requirement on the cite? 
  It required the data user to copy the following BibTeX as the citation:
  
  @misc{https://doi.org/10.25495/7gxk-rd71,
  doi = {10.25495/7GXK-RD71},

  language = {en},
  title = {Zenodo},
  publisher = {CERN},
  year = {2013}
}
  
* what is the license of the platofrm it self? of the data on it? 
  * Users must specify a license for all publicly available files. Licenses for closed access files may be specified in the description field.
 
 ### Description:
> Zenodo is a general-purpose open-access repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN. It allows researchers to deposit research papers, data sets, research software, reports, and any other research related digital artefacts. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citeable.
