 ### Description:
MatSQ is a cloud-based simulation platform for energy band structure calculations, density of states calculations charge density calculations, phonon spectra, energy comparisons, NEB calculations and optical characterisation projects. matSQ offers: (a) DFT based on Quantum Espresso (QE) runs. (b) Molecular dynamics simulations based on LAMMPS runs. (c) First principles calculations based on GAMESS. (d) Thermodynamic calculations based on the Calphad module.
