 ### Description:
> The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) contains data related to the natural sciences/engineering and technology/humanities/medicine and health sciences.
> It provides a federated and open multi-disciplinary environment for European researchers, innovators, companies and citizens, where they can publish, find and re-use data, tools and services for research, innovation and educational purposes. 
> Three of these databases and platforms are relevant to materials engineering: "DataverseNO", "Materials Cloud Archive" and "Pan- Learning.org".
